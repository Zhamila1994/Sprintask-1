        <h3>Jake Paul vs. Andre August results: Problem Child claims first-round KO for first win over pro boxer</h3>
        <p>CARIBE ROYALE ORLANDO, FLORIDA — Jake Paul continued his quest to become a legitimate boxer when he faced Andre August, a multi-time Golden Gloves winner. It took less than a minute for Paul to give his fans an early holiday gift as he knocked out August in the first round. <br><br>
            Paul, who lost against Tommy Fury earlier in the year, ended 2023 on a high note. “The Problem Child” came out to “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” with his brother Logan, the WWE United States Champion.<br><br>
            Nobody was sitting down in the packed arena from the opening bell, as all you could see were phones. The time the fight lasted was enough for a simple Snapchat story. <br><br>
            Both fighters stayed in the center of the ring to open the fight. It appeared to be Paul’s happy place as he landed dangerous counter shots. August went for a hook, and that was all Paul needed to land a counter right uppercut to take him out. The crowd erupted when Paul got his hands raised.<br><br>
